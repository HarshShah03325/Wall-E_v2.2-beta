## About the Workshop
- The main motive of the workshop is to introduce students with esp32 microcontroller, self-balancing and line following programs and the dynamics that work behind it.
- Hands on experience along with Hardware and Simulation.
- Capable of operating in an ultra-low-power mode, ideal for battery-powered applications.
